# Development

The easiest way to hack on braindump is with Vagrant

## Requirements
1. VirtualBox
2. Vagrant
3. Git

## Development Instructions
1. Fork and Clone this repo locally
2. `cd` into the new repo
3. Run `vagrant up`
4. The first time you run `vagrant up` the provisioner (scripts/bootstrap.sh) will run which takes a bit of time. Each subequent time will be much quicker.
5. Run `vagrant ssh` to enter the Vagrant box.
6. Go to the `/vagrant` directory with `cd /vagrant` which is a synced folder of your local git repo.
6. Run `scripts/start-dev.sh` to start the application
7. Go to localhost:5000 to view the app, any changes you make locally will be reflected in the Vagrant environment.

## Making Database Changes 

Braindump uses Flask SQLAlchemy as an ORM and Flask-Migrate to manage database migrations. 

# Deploying to Production
The only official method of deploying Braindump is with Docker. Braindump.pw is currently running on an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server on [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=15437cfec0948d105bf7478af2422241ed5da188). You can view `scripts/deploy.sh` to see how braindump is currently being deployed to production via CircleCI.

## Requirements
1. Docker and Docker Compose
2. SMTP (Required for Creating new Accounts and Sharing Notes)

## Deployment Instructions
1. Log into your Production Server and install Docker and Docker Compose
2. Create a new directory for braindump `mkdir -p /var/www/braindump`
3. Edit `scripts/secrets.sh` and add your site specific environment credentials.
4. Edit `etc/conf/nginx.conf` and add your site specific nginx configuration
5. From your local repo, send latest scripts to production Server

    ```
    rsync -avz scripts/ $USER@SERVER:/var/www/braindump/scripts/
    rsync -avz etc/ $USER@SERVER:/var/www/braindump/etc/
    scp docker-compose.yml $USER@SERVER:/var/www/braindump
    ```

6. From your local repo, log into production server, pull and restart Docker

    ```
    ssh $USER@SERVER 'cd /var/www/braindump && docker-compose pull'
    ssh $USER@SERVER 'cd /var/www/braindump && docker-compose build'
    ssh $USER@SERVER 'cd /var/www/braindump && source scripts/secrets.sh && docker-compose up -d'
    ```

7. (Optional) to set up automatic backups (every 6 hours) add the backup script to your crontab `crontab scripts/braindump-backup`

If all goes well, you will be able to navigate to $YOUR_SERVER in a browser and see the app. If you get a bad gateway error, or some other error try to run docker-compose in the foreground to get additional logging `cd /var/www/braindump && source scripts/secrets.sh && docker-compose up`
